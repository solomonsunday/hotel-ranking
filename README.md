### Hotel Ranking

This is a small react application called “Hotel Ranking” which looks good on the
outside (behaves correctly and shows your proficiency in css/widget libraries etc) and inside (code,
architecture, simplicity, cleanness).

## HOW TO IMPROVE THE APPLICATION

### Pagination for Large Datasets

Introducing pagination for the Hotel list page would enhance the application's scalability. This improvement ensures a smoother user experience when dealing with large datasets, preventing potential performance bottlenecks. Implementing a paginated approach allows users to explore extensive lists of users or repositories more efficiently.
