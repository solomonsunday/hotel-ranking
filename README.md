## Codygo - React Candidates Home

## Assessment

## Overview

Your assignment is to create a small react application called @`Hotel Ranking` which looks good on the
outside (behaves correctly and shows your proficiency in css/widget libraries etc) and inside (code,
architecture, simplicity, cleanness).
React Requirements

It is best if you create the application in Typescript and use hooks and modern React Idioms.
You can use any css mechanism/library, widget library and build tools that you want. You can use any
state mechanism/library you find fit or none at all.
Persistence should be done to local storage.

## Favorite Hotels Application Requirements

The application allows the user to maintain a list of ranked hotels and group them by chains.
You can view the list of all hostels, create, edit and delete each of the hotels. The list should allow
filtering by chain.

A hotel must have the following properties: Name, City, Country, Address. It might be part of a Hotel
Chain.

The Hotel Chain is a separate lightweight entity which also needs to be CRUD edited of course.
Whenever the user edits the data, it is persisted and never lost. The next time the application is opened,
the saved data is restored.

## Bonus Points

Responsiveness
Allow filtering by multiple chains.
Allow grouping by chain and show grouped.
Show the hotel location on a map.
Allow specifying address of hotel using a map.
